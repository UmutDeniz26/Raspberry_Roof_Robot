To edit code you should change Modules/Distance_Sensor/VL53L3CX_rasppi/example/main.c

To run the code you shold execute these commands:
    make example
    bin/main

VDD on sensor is left unconnected.
VIN on sensor to pin 1 3V3 on Raspberry Pi.
GND on sensor to pin 9 GND on Raspberry Pi.
SDA on sensor to pin 3 SDA on Raspberry Pi.
SCL on sensor to pin 5 SCL on Raspberry Pi.
XSHUT on sensor is left unconnected (it defaults pull up to VDD i.e. sensor is enabled).
GPIO1 on sensor is left unconnected (this goes high when a new measurement is ready).


Creating .so file
 cc -fPIC -shared -o my_functions.so -Icore/inc/ -Iplatform/inc/ example/main.c
